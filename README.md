===========

Tools for working with and automating VIRL PE deployments on http://packet.net/.  

These scripts are not required if you simply want to run VIRL PE on a virtual server hosted by http://packet.net/.  In that case, see https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/virlfaq/virlOnPacket and http://get.virl.info/packet.php.
