===========

Tools for working with and automating [VIRL PE](http://virl.cisco.com/) deployments on [Packet](http://packet.net/).  

These scripts are not required if you simply want to run VIRL PE on a server hosted by http://packet.net/.  In that case, see https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/virlfaq/virlOnPacket and http://get.virl.info/packet.php.
